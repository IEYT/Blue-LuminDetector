# Blue-LuminDetector

A setup with a light transistor and a blue led. The blue led activates when light intensity is less then 25 which is a analog no. The Arduino Uno R3's analog values range from 0-1023, but this project usually reaches 0-200. **Please use A0 for the Light trasistor and Digital Pin 10 for the Blue led so that the code works seamlessly.**
